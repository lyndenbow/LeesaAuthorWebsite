    How We Protect Your Personal Data
</p>
<p>
    In order to protect your security, we use the strongest available browser
    encryption and store all of our data on servers in secure facilities. All

    confidentiality agreements and a breach of this agreement would result in
    the employee's termination.
</p>
<p>
    While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure
    and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The
    Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to
    guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.
